CS 225 data structure team contract



Communication
Meeting: Our team will meet once per week every Tuesday 5-7pm Beijing time using Zoom. Notes will be committed to github.

Assitance: Each team member can be contacted using email or discord. 

Respect: we work hard to make sure everyone has a chance to speak.

Collaboration
Work Distribution: Each week, the necessary delivarables for the week will be determined by the full team and each member will volunteer to work on one or more deliverables. When no one volunteers, two team members will be randomly assigned to work on the task as a paired-programming team. If this leads to an unbalanced workload for the week, adjustments can be made on a case by case basis.

Time Commitment: To ensure an equal distribution of work, each member is expected to independently work no less than two and no more than six hours per week on the project.
If a deliverable ends up taking more time, the rest of the team should be pulled in to assist
with the unforseen complication, with each member taking an equal share of the workload or
programming in pairs. It is the team’s responsibility, not the individual’s responsibility, to
make sure a weekly deliverable is finished by the end of the week.

Conflict Resolution: All conflicts within the team will be decided by a Super Smash Bros match, Final Destination, 3 stock no items. The winner will decide who was right and who
was wrong (Might makes right).
