CS 225 data structure team contract



Communication
Meeting: Our team will meet twice per week every Wednesday and Friday 5-7pm Beijing time using Zoom, and make flexible adjustments (postpone if people have exams to be prepared and have extra meetings when we feel like there should be one). Notes will be committed to our final project git repo with time-stamped for each meeting.

Assitance: Each team member can be contacted using Wechat or school email. We commit to responding to messages ASAP. 

Respect: Every group member has to have a chance to speak or state their opinion, and everyone should pay attention to the speaker and take notes. Design decisions can be accpted by simple majority - while unanimous agreement is preferred, it is not required. Each member of the team commits to adhering to the decisions made, even if they personally disagree with them.

Collaboration
Work Distribution: Each week, the necessary delivarables for the week will be determined by the full team and each member will volunteer to work on one or more deliverables. When no one volunteers, two team members will be randomly assigned to work on the task as a paired-programming team. If this leads to an unbalanced workload for the week, adjustments can be made on a case by case basis.

Time Commitment: To ensure an equal distribution of work, each member is expected to independently work no less than two and no more than ten hours per week on the project.If a deliverable ends up taking more time, the rest of the team should be pulled in to assist with the unforseen complication, with each member taking an equal share of the workload or programming in pairs. It is the team’s responsibility, not the individual’s responsibility, to make sure a weekly deliverable is finished by the end of the week.

Conflict Resolution: All conflicts within the team will be decided by rolling dice in the Wechat group. People who gets the biggest number is the winner. If there happens to have a draw, we do this one more time:)
