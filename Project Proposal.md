# Final Project Proposal 

## 1.Leading Question
### For a depature city and a detination, we will search for an optimal travel solution considering time, distance and money spent.
    
## 2.Dataset Acquisition and Processing
### We will use data from Open Flights dataset to build a graph with each edge weighted so that it represents the cost of each travel.

## 3.Graph Algorithms
### We will use Dijkstra's algorithm to search for a path of minimum sum of weights(least time, least distance traveled, least money spend).
### By adjusting the weight of the three , we will then search for an optimal considering all three factors. 

## 4.Timeline
### Contract & Proposal
### April 7 - sync to complete project proposal and team contract
### April 9 - submit project proposal and team contract

### Basic setup for git
### April 11 - set up initial repository and Makefile

### data acquisition
### April 12 - determine and acquire the data we need for the project

### Data processing
### April 15 - finish reading in data into array format and write simple tests to verify correctness
### April 19 - convert array format into graph format and pass simple tests

### Completion of each individual algorithm with tests
### April 22 - write BFS iterator and verify with tests
### April 29 - write Dijikstra's and verify with tests

### Production of final deliverables
### May 7 - finish project (pass all tests for time, distance, and cost) 
### May 8 - finish report
### May 9 - sync to record final presentation
### May 11 - finish editing presentation and submit

## 5. Test
### We will build our own test cases in advance to make sure our code works as desired
