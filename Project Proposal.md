# Final Project Proposal 

## 1.Leading Question
### For a depature city and a detination, we will search for an optimal travel solution considering time, distance and money spent.
    

## 2.Dataset Acquisition and Processing
### We will use data from Open Flights dataset to build a graph with each edge weighted so that it represents the cost of each travel.
## 3.Graph Algorithms
### We will use Dijkstra's algorithm to search for a path of minimum sum of weights(least time, least distance traveled, least money spend).
### By adjusting the weight of the three , we will then search for an optimal considering all three factors. 

## 4.Timeline
* data acquisition
* data processing
* completion of each individual algorithm
* test
* production of final deliverables

## 5. Test
### We will build our own test cases in advance to make sure our code works as desired
